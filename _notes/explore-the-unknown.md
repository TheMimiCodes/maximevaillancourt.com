title: Explore the unknown
---

As we become adults and become more and more specialized in a given domain, there's an assumption that we have a fair amount of knowledge relating to that domain of expertise, and that knowledge inherently becomes tied to our egos since it's a defining part of who we are.

For example, as a software developer, I am expected to know about basic computer science concepts, and if I trip up when explaining a given topic to a peer, it's a shame because I _should_ know it pretty well, but clearly don't. Doubt then starts to creep it, and we think, "if I don't know this basic concept, what do I know?".

This sort of pressure can become paralyzing in that there is always a fear of making a mistake. There is, however, a way to remedy this paralysis:

**Explore the unknown** for the sake of it.

What you learn something new, you're not expected to know anything. Exit certainty.
